- Computer with Windows operating system
- Internet connection for package downloads

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Set up a complete Python development environment
- Work with SQLite databases and execute basic queries
- Manage Python packages and dependencies
- Create and manage virtual environments
- Use basic Git commands for version control
- Configure VS Code for Python development
- Organize Python projects effectively

## Weekly Project
Create a simple Python project that:
1. Uses a virtual environment
2. Has a proper directory structure
3. Includes a requirements.txt file
4. Uses SQLite for data storage
5. Is version controlled with Git
6. Is properly formatted and linted in VS Code

## Next Steps
After completing this week's content, you'll be ready to move on to Week 2, where we'll dive deeper into data loading and database operations.
