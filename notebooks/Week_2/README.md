# Week 2: Data Loading and Database Management

## Overview
This week focuses on advanced database operations, data loading techniques, and best practices for managing data pipelines. You'll learn how to use SQLAlchemy, design efficient databases, and implement robust data loading processes.

## Learning Path

- Index optimization
- Data types and constraints
- Schema migration strategies

### 3. Data Loading Scripts (`03_data_loading.ipynb`)
- ETL process implementation
- Batch processing
- Data transformation techniques
- Loading strategies
- Performance optimization

### 4. Error Handling (`04_error_handling.ipynb`)
- Exception handling in Python
- Database transaction management
- Rollback strategies
- Error logging
- Recovery procedures

### 5. Data Validation (`05_data_validation.ipynb`)
- Input data validation
- Data quality checks
- Schema validation
- Custom validators
- Validation pipelines

### 6. Database Relationships (`06_database_relationships.ipynb`)
- One-to-One relationships
- One-to-Many relationships
- Many-to-Many relationships
- Relationship management
- Cascade operations

### 7. Query Optimization (`07_query_optimization.ipynb`)
- Query performance analysis
- Index optimization
- Query planning
- Caching strategies
- Performance monitoring

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Week 1
- Basic SQL knowledge
- Understanding of Python basics
- Familiarity with data structures

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Use SQLAlchemy for database operations
- Design efficient database schemas
- Create robust data loading pipelines
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate and clean data effectively
- Work with complex database relationships
- Optimize database queries

## Weekly Project
Build a data loading pipeline that:
1. Uses SQLAlchemy for database operations
2. Implements proper error handling
3. Includes data validation
4. Handles complex relationships
5. Is optimized for performance
6. Includes proper logging and monitoring

## Next Steps
After completing this week's content, you'll be ready to move on to Week 3, where we'll focus on data analysis and visualization techniques.
