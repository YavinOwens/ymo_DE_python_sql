## Weekly Project
Create a comprehensive dashboard that:
1. Loads and cleans HR data
2. Performs exploratory data analysis
3. Creates various types of visualizations
4. Includes interactive elements
5. Tells a compelling data story
6. Is well-documented and maintainable

## Next Steps
After completing this week's content, you'll be ready to move on to Week 4, where we'll focus on integration and advanced features.
